I hit my target with the hidden spoon while in public. Nobody but me sees the hidden spoon (except that my target feels the touch). Does this count as a kill? Also, can my victim stun me in this situation?</span></p><p class="c8 c4 c11"><span>A: The rules specify no one except you and your target can see the &quot;attacking spoon.&quot; &nbsp;Conversely, your target can use defensive maneuvering because he/she sees you with a spoon and could reasonably believe you&#39;re his/her assassin. &nbsp;So in short, the attack with the hidden spoon is valid, but the visible spoon empowers your target to act defensively.</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>Q: In order to be poisoned, does the victim have to eat / drink from the object under which the piece of paper is placed, after it is placed, or is it enough if one just manages to place the piece of paper there? &nbsp;Specifically, I want to know what happens in the following situation: someone places the paper under my plate, but I lift the plate and I find it before I eat something from the plate. Does this count as a kill?</span></p><p class="c8 c4 c11"><span>A: The poison only works if the food/drink is consumed. &nbsp;The best defense against poison is checking under every plate or glass before you eat or drink and removing/crumpling any poison cards.</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c11"><span></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>Q: Since transportation is considered &quot;safe,&quot; are you safe as soon as you touch a bike? Do you have to get on it? Put the kickstand up?</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c8 c4 c11"><span>A: The transportation safe zone is defined as: &quot;While on any form of transportation (e.g. busses, bikes, cars, etc.).&quot; [emphasis added] &nbsp;With respect to bikes, &quot;on&quot; a bike means the rider is mounted (i.e. one leg on either side, ability to start riding, etc). &nbsp;If the person is just getting to a bike, adjusting the seat, or putting up the kickstand, they (most likely) have not mounted the bike and therefore are not safe. </span></p><p class="c3 c4 c11"><span></span></p><p class="c8 c4 c11"><span>However, we would greatly prefer that you do not attempt to assassinate someone while they are near transportation as that might not be physically safe.</span></p><p class="c3 c4 c11"><span></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>Q: Can I make my target remove their safety item?</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: You may not physically do so, nor have anyone else physically do so besides them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span></span></p>
